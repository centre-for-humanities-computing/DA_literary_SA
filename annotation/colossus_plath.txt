THE MANOR GARDEN\nThe fountains are dry and the roses over.\nLicense of death. Your day approaches.\nThe pears fatten like little buddhas.\nA blue mist is dragging the lake.\nYou move through the era of fishes,\nThe smug centuries of the pig—\nHead, toe and finger\nCome clear of the shadow. History\nNourishes these broken flutings,\nThese crowns of acanthus,\nAnd the crow settles her garments.\nYou inherit white heather, a bee's wing,\nTwo suicides, the family wolves,\nHours of blankness. Some hard stars\nAlready yellow the heavens.\nThe spider on its own string\nCrosses the lake. The worms\nQuit their usual habitations.\nThe small birds converge, converge\nWith their gifts to a difficult borning.\n\nTWO VIEWS OF A CADAVER ROOM\nThe day she visited the dissecting room\nThey had four men laid out, black as burnt turkey,\nAlready half unstrung. A vinegary fume\nOf the death vats clung to them;\nThe white-smocked boys started working.\nThe head of his cadaver had caved in,\nAnd she could scarcely make out anything\nIn that rubble of skull plates and old leather.\nA sallow piece of string held it together.\nIn their jars the snail-nosed babies moon and glow.\nHe hands her the cut-out heart like a cracked heirloom.\nIn Brueghel's panorama of smoke and slaughter\nTwo people only are blind to the carrion army:\nHe, afloat in the sea of her blue satin\nSkirts, sings in the direction\nOf her bare shoulder, while she bends,\nFingering a leaflet of music, over him,\nBoth of them deaf to the fiddle in the hands\nOf the death's-head shadowing their song.\nThese Flemish lovers flourish; not for long.\nYet desolation, stalled in paint, spares the little country\nFoolish, delicate, in the lower right hand corner.\n\nNIGHT SHIFT\nIt was not a heart, beating,\nThat muted boom, that clangour\nFar off, not blood in the ears\nDrumming up any fever\nTo impose on the evening.\nThe noise came from the outside:\nA metal detonating\nNative, evidently, to\nThese stilled suburbs: nobody\nStartled at it, though the sound\nShook the ground with its pounding.\nIt took root at my coming\nTill the thudding source, e\nposed,\nConfounded inept guesswork:\nFramed in windows of Main Street's\nSilver factory, immense\nHammers hoisted, wheels turning,\nStalled, let fall their vertical\nTonnage of metal and wood;\nStunned the marrow. Men in white\nUndershirts circled, tending\nWithout stop those greased machines,\nTending, without stop, the blunt\nIndefatigable fact.\n\nSOW\nGod knows how our neighbour managed to breed\nHis great sow:\nWhatever his shrewd secret, he kept it hid\nIn the same way\nHe kept the sow—impounded from public stare,\nPrize ribbon and pig show.\nBut one dusk our questions commended us to a tour\nThrough his lantern-lit\nMaze of barns to the lintel of the sunk sty door\nTo gape at it:\nThis was no rose-and-larkspurred china suckling\nWith a penny slot\nFor thrifty children, nor dolt pig ripe for heckling,\nAbout to be\nGlorified for prime flesh and golden crackling\nIn a parsley halo;\nNor even one of the common barnyard sows,\nMire-smirched, blowzy,\nMaunching thistle and knotweed on her snout-cruise—\nBloat tun of milk\nOn the move, hedged by a litter of feat-foot ninnies\nShrilling her hulk\nTo halt for a swig at the pink teats. No. This vast\nBrobdingnag bulk\nOf a sow lounged belly-bedded on that black compost,\nFat-rutted eyes\nDream-filmed. What a vision of ancient hoghood must\nThus wholly engross\nThe great grandam!—our marvel blazoned a knight,\nHelmed, in cuirass,\nUnhorsed and shredded in the grove of combat\nBy a grisly-bristled\nBoar, fabulous enough to straddle that sow's heat.\nBut our farmer whistled,\nThen, with a jocular fist thwacked the barrel nape,\nAnd the green-copse-castled\nPig hove, letting legend like dried mud drop,\nSlowly, grunt\nOn grunt, up in the flickering light to shape\nA monument\nProdigious in gluttonies as that hog whose want\nMade lean Lent\nOf kitchen slops and, stomaching no constraint,\nProceeded to swill\nThe seven troughed seas and every earthquaking continent.\n\nTHE EYE-MOTE\nBlameless as daylight I stood looking\nAt a field of horses, necks bent, manes blown,\nTails streaming against the green\nBackdrop of sycamores. Sun was striking\nWhite chapel pinnacles over the roofs,\nHolding the horses, the clouds, the leaves\nSteadily rooted though they were all flowing\nAway to the left like reeds in a sea\nWhen the splinter flew in and stuck my eye,\nNeedling it dark. Then I was seeing\nA melding of shapes in a hot rain:\nHorses warped on the altering green,\nOutlandish as double-humped camels or unicorns,\nGrazing at the margins of a bad monochrome,\nBeasts of oasis, a better time.\nAbrading my lid, the small grain burns:\nRed cinder around which I myself,\nHorses, planets and spires revolve.\nNeither tears nor the easing flush\nOf eyebaths can unseat the speck:\nIt sticks, and it has stuck a week.\nI wear the present itch for flesh,\nBlind to what will be and what was.\nI dream that I am Oedipus.\nWhat I want back is what I was\nBefore the bed, before the knife,\nBefore the brooch-pin and the salve\nFi\ned me in this parenthesis;\nHorses fluent in the wind,\nA place, a time gone out of mind.\n\nHARDCASTLE CRAGS\nFlintlike, her feet struck\nSuch a racket of echoes from the steely street,\nTacking in moon-blued crooks from the black\nStone-built town, that she heard the quick air ignite\nIts tinder and shake\nA firework of echoes from wall\nTo wall of the dark, dwarfed cottages.\nBut the echoes died at her back as the walls\nGave way to fields and the incessant seethe of grasses\nRiding in the full\nOf the moon, manes to the wind,\nTireless, tied, as a moon-bound sea\nMoves on its root. Though a mist-wraith wound\nUp from the fissured valley and hung shoulder-high\nAhead, it fattened\nTo no family-featured ghost,\nNor did any word body with a name\nThe blank mood she walked in. Once past\nThe dream-peopled village, her eyes entertained no dream,\nAnd the sandman's dust\nLost lustre under her footsoles.\nThe long wind, paring her person down\nTo a pinch of flame, blew its burdened whistle\nIn the whorl of her ear, and like a scooped-out pumpkin crown\nHer head cupped the babel.\nAll the night gave her, in return\nFor the paltry gift of her bulk and the beat\nOf her heart was the humped indifferent iron\nOf its hills, and its pastures bordered by black stone set\nOn black stone. Barns\nGuarded broods and litters\nBehind shut doors; the dairy herds\nKnelt in the meadow mute as boulders;\nSheep drowsed stoneward in their tussocks of wool, and birds,\nTwig-sleeping, wore\nGranite ruffs, their shadows\nThe guise of leaves. The whole landscape\nLoomed absolute as the antique world was\nOnce, in its earliest sway of lymph and sap,\nUnaltered by eyes,\nEnough to snuff the quick\nOf her small heat out, but before the weight\nOf stones and hills of stones could break\nHer down to mere quartz grit in that stony light\nShe turned back.\n\nFAUN\nHaunched like a faun, he hooed\nFrom grove of moon-glint and fen-frost\nUntil all owls in the twigged forest\nFlapped black to look and brood\nOn the call this man made.\nNo sound but a drunken coot\nLurching home along river bank.\nStars hung water-sunk, so a rank\nOf double star-eyes lit\nBoughs where those owls sat.\nAn arena of yellow eyes\nWatched the changing shape he cut,\nSaw hoof harden from foot, saw sprout\nGoat-horns. Marked how god rose\nAnd galloped woodward in that guise.\n\nDEPARTURE\nThe figs on the fig tree in the yard are green;\nGreen, also, the grapes on the green vine\nShading the brickred porch tiles.\nThe money's run out.\nHow nature, sensing this, compounds her bitters.\nUngifted, ungrieved, our leavetaking.\nThe sun shines on unripe corn.\nCats play in the stalks.\nRetrospect shall not soften such penury—\nSun's brass, the moon's steely patinas,\nThe leaden slag of the world—\nBut always e\npose\nThe scraggy rock spit shielding the town's blue bay\nAgainst which the brunt of outer sea\nBeats, is brutal endlessly.\nGull-fouled, a stone hut\nBares its low lintel to corroding weathers:\nAcross that jut of ochreous rock\nGoats shamble, morose, rank-haired,\nTo lick the sea-salt.\n\nTHE COLOSSUS\nI shall never get you put together entirely,\nPieced, glued, and properly jointed.\nMule-bray, pig-grunt and bawdy cackles\nProceed from your great lips.\nIt's worse than a barnyard.\nPerhaps you consider yourself an oracle,\nMouthpiece of the dead, or of some god or other.\nThirty years now I have laboured\nTo dredge the silt from your throat.\nI am none the wiser.\nScaling little ladders with gluepots and pails of lysol\nI crawl like an ant in mourning\nOver the weedy acres of your brow\nTo mend the immense skull-plates and clear\nThe bald, white tumuli of your eyes.\nA blue sky out of the Oresteia\nArches above us. O father, all by yourself\nYou are pithy and historical as the Roman Forum.\nI open my lunch on a hill of black cypress.\nYour fluted bones and acanthine hair are littered\nIn their old anarchy to the horizon-line.\nIt would take more than a lightning-stroke\nTo create such a ruin.\nNights, I squat in the cornucopia\nOf your left ear, out of the wind,\nCounting the red stars and those of plum-colour.\nThe sun rises under the pillar of your tongue.\nMy hours are married to shadow.\nNo longer do I listen for the scrape of a keel\nOn the blank stones of the landing.\n\nLORELEI\nIt is no night to drown in:\nA full moon, river lapsing\nBlack beneath bland mirror-sheen,\nThe blue water-mists dropping\nScrim after scrim like fishnets\nThough fishermen are sleeping,\nThe massive castle turrets\nDoubling themselves in a glass\nAll stillness. Yet these shapes float\nUp toward me, troubling the face\nOf quiet. From the nadir\nThey rise, their limbs ponderous\nWith richness, hair heavier\nThan sculpted marble. They sing\nOf a world more full and clear\nThan can be. Sisters, your song\nBears a burden too weighty\nFor the whorled ear's listening\nHere, in a well-steered country,\nUnder a balanced ruler.\nDeranging by harmony\nBeyond the mundane order,\nYour voices lay siege. You lodge\nOn the pitched reefs of nightmare,\nPromising sure harbourage;\nBy day, descant from borders\nOf hebetude, from the ledge\nAlso of high windows. Worse\nEven than your maddening\nSong, your silence. At the source\nOf your ice-hearted calling—\nDrunkenness of the great depths.\nO river, I see drifting\nDeep in your flu\n of silver\nThose great goddesses of peace.\nStone, stone, ferry me down there.\n\nPOINT SHIRLEY\nFrom Water-Tower Hill to the brick prison\nThe shingle booms, bickering under\nThe sea's collapse.\nSnowcakes break and welter. This year\nThe gritted wave leaps\nThe seawall and drops onto a bier\nOf quahog chips,\nLeaving a salty mash of ice to whiten\nIn my grandmother's sand yard. She is dead,\nWhose laundry snapped and froze here, who\nKept house against\nWhat the sluttish, rutted sea could do.\nSquall waves once danced\nShip timbers in through the cellar window;\nA thresh-tailed, lanced\nShark littered in the geranium bed—\nSuch collusion of mulish elements\nShe wore her broom straws to the nub.\nTwenty years out\nOf her hand, the house still hugs in each drab\nStucco socket\nThe purple egg-stones: from Great Head's knob\nTo the filled-in Gut\nThe sea in its cold gizzard ground those rounds.\nNobody wintering now behind\nThe planked-up windows where she set\nHer wheat loaves\nAnd apple cakes to cool. What is it\nSurvives, grieves\nSo, over this battered, obstinate spit\nOf gravel? The waves'\nSpewed relics clicker masses in the wind,\nGrey waves the stub-necked eiders ride.\nA labour of love, and that labour lost.\nSteadily the sea\nEats at Point Shirley. She died blessed,\nAnd I come by\nBones, bones only, pawed and tossed,\nA dog-faced sea.\nThe sun sinks under Boston, bloody red.\nI would get from these dry-papped stones\nThe milk your love instilled in them.\nThe black ducks dive.\nAnd though your graciousness might stream,\nAnd I contrive,\nGrandmother, stones are nothing of home\nTo that spumiest dove.\nAgainst both bar and tower the black sea runs.\n\nTHE BULL OF BENDYLAW\nThe black bull bellowed before the sea.\nThe sea, till that day orderly,\nHove up against Bendylaw.\nThe queen in the mulberry arbour stared\nStiff as a queen on a playing card.\nThe king fingered his beard.\nA blue sea, four horny bull-feet,\nA bull-snouted sea that wouldn't stay put,\nBucked at the garden gate.\nAlong bo\n-lined walks in the florid sun\nToward the rowdy bellow and back again\nThe lords and ladies ran.\nThe great bronze gate began to crack,\nThe sea broke in at every crack,\nPellmell, blueblack.\nThe bull surged up, the bull surged down,\nNot to be stayed by a daisy chain\nNor by any learned man.\nO the king's tidy acre is under the sea,\nAnd the royal rose in the bull's belly,\nAnd the bull on the king's highway.\n\nALL THE DEAD DEARS\nIn the Archaeological Museum in Cambridge is a\nstone coffin of the fourth century A.D. containing the\nskeletons of a woman, a mouse and a shrew. The\nankle-bone of the woman has been slightly gnawn.\nRigged poker-stiff on her back\nWith a granite grin\nThis antique museum-cased lady\nLies, companioned by the gimcrack\nRelics of a mouse and a shrew\nThat battened for a day on her ankle-bone.\nThese three, unmasked now, bear\nDry witness\nTo the gross eating game\nWe'd wink at if we didn't hear\nStars grinding, crumb by crumb,\nOur own grist down to its bony face.\nHow they grip us through thin and thick,\nThese barnacle dead!\nThis lady here's no kin\nOf mine, yet kin she is: she'll suck\nBlood and whistle my marrow clean\nTo prove it. As I think now of her head,\nFrom the mercury-backed glass\nMother, grandmother, greatgrandmother\nReach hag hands to haul me in,\nAnd an image looms under the fishpond surface\nWhere the daft father went down\nWith orange duck-feet winnowing his hair—\nAll the long gone darlings: they\nGet back, though, soon,\nSoon: be it by wakes, weddings,\nChildbirths or a family barbecue:\nAny touch, taste, tang's\nFit for those outlaws to ride home on,\nAnd to sanctuary: usurping the armchair\nBetween rick\nAnd tack of the clock, until we go,\nEach skulled-and-crossboned Gulliver\nRiddled with ghosts, to lie\nDeadlocked with them, taking root as cradles rock.\n\nAFTERMATH\nCompelled by calamity's magnet\nThey loiter and stare as if the house\nBurnt-out were theirs, or as if they thought\nSome scandal might any minute ooze\nFrom a smoke-choked closet into light;\nNo deaths, no prodigious injuries\nGlut these hunters after an old meat,\nBlood-spoor of the austere tragedies.\nMother Medea in a green smock\nMoves humbly as any housewife through\nHer ruined apartments, taking stock\nOf charred shoes, the sodden upholstery:\nCheated of the pyre and the rack,\nThe crowd sucks her last tear and turns away.\n\nTHE THIN PEOPLE\nThey are always with us, the thin people\nMeagre of dimension as the grey people\nOn a movie-screen. They\nAre unreal, we say:\nIt was only in a movie, it was only\nIn a war making evil headlines when we\nWere small that they famished and\nGrew so lean and would not round\nOut their stalky limbs again though peace\nPlumped the bellies of the mice\nUnder the meanest table.\nIt was during the long hunger-battle\nThey found their talent to persevere\nIn thinness, to come, later,\nInto our bad dreams, their menace\nNot guns, not abuses,\nBut a thin silence.\nWrapped in flea-ridden donkey skins,\nEmpty of complaint, forever\nDrinking vinegar from tin cups: they wore\nThe insufferable nimbus of the lot-drawn\nScapegoat. But so thin,\nSo weedy a race could not remain in dreams,\nCould not remain outlandish victims\nIn the contracted country of the head\nAny more than the old woman in her mud hut could\nKeep from cutting fat meat\nOut of the side of the generous moon when it\nSet foot nightly in her yard\nUntil her knife had pared\nThe moon to a rind of little light.\nNow the thin people do not obliterate\nThemselves as the dawn\nGreyness blues, reddens, and the outline\nOf the world comes clear and fills with colour.\nThey persist in the sunlit room: the wallpaper\nFrieze of cabbage-roses and cornflowers pales\nUnder their thin-lipped smiles,\nTheir withering kingship.\nHow they prop each other up!\nWe own no wildernesses rich and deep enough\nFor stronghold against their stiff\nBattalions. See, how the tree boles flatten\nAnd lose their good browns\nIf the thin people simply stand in the forest,\nMaking the world go thin as a wasp's nest\nAnd greyer; not even moving their bones.\n\nSUICIDE OFF EGG ROCK\nBehind him the hotdogs split and drizzled\nOn the public grills, and the ochreous salt flats,\nGas tanks, factory stacks—that landscape\nOf imperfections his bowels were part of—\nRippled and pulsed in the glassy updraught.\nSun struck the water like a damnation.\nNo pit of shadow to crawl into,\nAnd his blood beating the old tattoo\nI am, I am, I am. Children\nWere squealing where combers broke and the spindrift\nRavelled wind-ripped from the crest of the wave.\nA mongrel working his legs to a gallop\nHustled a gull flock to flap off the sandspit.\nHe smouldered, as if stone-deaf, blindfold,\nHis body beached with the sea's garbage,\nA machine to breathe and beat forever.\nFlies filing in through a dead skate's eyehole\nBuzzed and assailed the vaulted brainchamber.\nThe words in his book wormed off the pages.\nEverything glittered like blank paper.\nEverything shrank in the sun's corrosive\nRay but Egg Rock on the blue wastage.\nHe heard when he walked into the water\nThe forgetful surf creaming on those ledges.\n\nMUSHROOMS\nOvernight, very\nWhitely, discreetly,\nVery quietly\nOur toes, our noses\nTake hold on the loam,\nAcquire the air.\nNobody sees us,\nStops us, betrays us;\nThe small grains make room.\nSoft fists insist on\nHeaving the needles,\nThe leafy bedding,\nEven the paving.\nOur hammers, our rams,\nEarless and eyeless,\nPerfectly voiceless,\nWiden the crannies,\nShoulder through holes. We\nDiet on water,\nOn crumbs of shadow,\nBland-mannered, asking\nLittle or nothing.\nSo many of us!\nSo many of us!\nWe are shelves, we are\nTables, we are meek,\nWe are edible,\nNudgers and shovers\nIn spite of ourselves.\nOur kind multiplies:\nWe shall by morning\nInherit the earth.\nOur foot's in the door.\n\nI WANT, I WANT\nOpen-mouthed, the baby god\nImmense, bald, though baby-headed,\nCried out for the mother's dug.\nThe dry volcanoes cracked and spit,\nSand abraded the milkless lip.\nCried then for the father's blood\nWho set wasp, wolf and shark to work,\nEngineered the gannet's beak.\nDry-eyed, the inveterate patriarch\nRaised his men of skin and bone,\nBarbs on the crown of gilded wire,\nThorns on the bloody rose-stem.\n\nWATERCOLOUR OF GRANTCHESTER MEADOWS\nThere, spring lambs jam the sheepfold. In air\nStilled, silvered as water in a glass\nNothing is big or far.\nThe small shrew chitters from its wilderness\nOf grassheads and is heard.\nEach thumb-size bird\nFlits nimble-winged in thickets, and of good colour.\nCloudrack and owl-hollowed willows slanting over\nThe bland Granta double their white and green\nWorld under the sheer water\nAnd ride that flu\n at anchor, upside down.\nThe punter sinks his pole.\nIn Byron's pool\nCat-tails part where the tame cygnets steer.\nIt is a country on a nursery plate.\nSpotted cows revolve their jaws and crop\nRed clover or gnaw beetroot\nBellied on a nimbus of sun-glazed buttercup.\nHedging meadows of benign\nArcadian green\nThe blood-berried hawthorn hides its spines with white.\nDroll, vegetarian, the water rat\nSaws down a reed and swims from his limber grove,\nWhile the students stroll or sit,\nHands laced, in a moony indolence of love—\nBlack-gowned, but unaware\nHow in such mild air\nThe owl shall stoop from his turret, the rat cry out.\n\nTHE GHOST'S LEAVETAKING\nEnter the chilly no-man's land of about\nFive o'clock in the morning, the no-colour void\nWhere the waking head rubbishes out the draggled lot\nOf sulphurous dreamscapes and obscure lunar conundrums\nWhich seemed, when dreamed, to mean so profoundly much,\nGets ready to face the ready-made creation\nOf chairs and bureaus and sleep-twisted sheets.\nThis is the kingdom of the fading apparition,\nThe oracular ghost who dwindles on pin-legs\nTo a knot of laundry, with a classic bunch of sheets\nUpraised, as a hand, emblematic of farewell.\nAt this joint between two worlds and two entirely\nIncompatible modes of time, the raw material\nOf our meat-and-potato thoughts assumes the nimbus\nOf ambrosial revelation. And so departs.\nChair and bureau are the hieroglyphs\nOf some godly utterance wakened heads ignore:\nSo these posed sheets, before they thin to nothing,\nSpeak in sign language of a lost otherworld,\nA world we lose by merely waking up.\nTrailing its telltale tatters only at the outermost\nFringe of mundane vision, this ghost goes\nHand aloft, goodbye, goodbye, not down\nInto the rocky gizzard of the earth,\nBut toward a region where our thick atmosphere\nDiminishes, and God knows what is there.\nA point of e\nclamation marks that sky\nIn ringing orange like a stellar carrot.\nIts round period, displaced and green,\nSuspends beside it the first point, the starting\nPoint of Eden, ne\nt the new moon's curve.\nGo, ghost of our mother and father, ghost of us,\nAnd ghost of our dreams' children, in those sheets\nWhich signify our origin and end,\nTo the cloud-cuckoo land of colour wheels\nAnd pristine alphabets and cows that moo\nAnd moo as they jump over moons as new\nAs that crisp cusp toward which you voyage now.\nHail and farewell. Hello, goodbye. O keeper\nOf the profane grail, the dreaming skull.\n\nMETAPHORS\nI'm a riddle in nine syllables,\nAn elephant, a ponderous house,\nA melon strolling on two tendrils.\nO red fruit, ivory, fine timbers!\nThis loaf's big with its yeasty rising.\nMoney's new-minted in this fat purse.\nI'm a means, a stage, a cow in calf.\nI've eaten a bag of green apples,\nBoarded the train there's no getting off.\n\nBLACK ROOK IN RAINY WEATHER\nOn the stiff twig up there\nHunches a wet black rook\nArranging and rearranging its feathers in the rain.\nI do not e\npect miracle\nOr an accident\nTo set the sight on fire\nIn my eye, nor seek\nAny more in the desultory weather some design,\nBut let spotted leaves fall as they fall,\nWithout ceremony, or portent.\nAlthough, I admit, I desire,\nOccasionally, some backtalk\nFrom the mute sky, I can't honestly complain:\nA certain minor light may still\nLeap incandescent\nOut of kitchen table or chair\nAs if a celestial burning took\nPossession of the most obtuse objects now and then—\nThus hallowing an interval\nOtherwise inconsequent\nBy bestowing largesse, honour,\nOne might say love. At any rate, I now walk\nWary (for it could happen\nEven in this dull, ruinous landscape); sceptical,\nYet politic; ignorant\nOf whatever angel may choose to flare\nSuddenly at my elbow. I only know that a rook\nOrdering its black feathers can so shine\nAs to seize my senses, haul\nMy eyelids up, and grant\nA brief respite from fear\nOf total neutrality. With luck,\nTrekking stubborn through this season\nOf fatigue, I shall\nPatch together a content\nOf sorts. Miracles occur,\nIf you care to call those spasmodic\nTricks of radiance miracles. The wait's begun again,\nThe long wait for the angel,\nFor that rare, random descent.\n\nA WINTER SHIP\nAt this wharf there are no grand landings to speak of.\nRed and orange barges list and blister\nShackled to the dock, outmoded, gaudy,\nAnd apparently indestructible.\nThe sea pulses under a skin of oil.\nA gull holds his pose on a shanty ridgepole,\nRiding the tide of the wind, steady\nAs wood and formal, in a jacket of ashes,\nThe whole flat harbour anchored in\nThe round of his yellow eye-button.\nA blimp swims up like a day-moon or tin\nCigar over his rink of fishes.\nThe prospect is dull as an old etching.\nThey are unloading three barrels of little crabs.\nThe pier pilings seem about to collapse\nAnd with them that rickety edifice\nOf warehouses, derricks, smokestacks and bridges\nIn the distance. All around us the water slips\nAnd gossips in its loose vernacular,\nFerrying the smells of dead cod and tar.\nFarther out, the waves will be mouthing icecakes—\nA poor month for park-sleepers and lovers.\nEven our shadows are blue with cold.\nWe wanted to see the sun come up\nAnd are met, instead, by this iceribbed ship,\nBearded and blown, an albatross of frost,\nRelic of tough weather, every winch and stay\nEncased in a glassy pellicle.\nThe sun will diminish it soon enough:\nEach wave-tip glitters like a knife.\n\nFULL FATHOM FIVE\nOld man, you surface seldom.\nThen you come in with the tide's coming\nWhen seas wash cold, foam-\nCapped: white hair, white beard, far-flung,\nA dragnet, rising, falling, as waves\nCrest and trough. Miles long\nE\ntend the radial sheaves\nOf your spread hair, in which wrinkling skeins\nKnotted, caught, survives\nThe old myth of origins\nUnimaginable. You float near\nAs keeled ice-mountains\nOf the north, to be steered clear\nOf, not fathomed. All obscurity\nStarts with a danger:\nYour dangers are many. I\nCannot look much but your form suffers\nSome strange injury\nAnd seems to die: so vapours\nRavel to clearness on the dawn sea.\nThe muddy rumours\nOf your burial move me\nTo half-believe: your reappearance\nProves rumours shallow,\nFor the archaic trenched lines\nOf your grained face shed time in runnels:\nAges beat like rains\nOn the unbeaten channels\nOf the ocean. Such sage humour and\nDurance are whirlpools\nTo make away with the ground-\nWork of the earth and the sky's ridgepole.\nWaist down, you may wind\nOne labyrinthine tangle\nTo root deep among knuckles, shinbones,\nSkulls. Inscrutable,\nBelow shoulders not once\nSeen by any man who kept his head,\nYou defy questions;\nYou defy other godhood.\nI walk dry on your kingdom's border\nE\niled to no good.\nYour shelled bed I remember.\nFather, this thick air is murderous.\nI would breathe water.\n\nMAUDLIN\nMud-mattressed under the sign of the hag\nIn a clench of blood, the sleep-talking virgin\nGibbets with her curse the moon's man,\nFaggot-bearing Jack in his crackless egg:\nHatched with a claret hogshead to swig\nHe kings it, navel-knit to no groan,\nBut at the price of a pin-stitched skin\nFish-tailed girls purchase each white leg.\n\nBLUE MOLES\n1\nThey're out of the dark's ragbag, these two\nMoles dead in the pebbled rut,\nShapeless as flung gloves, a few feet apart—\nBlue suede a dog or fo\n has chewed.\nOne, by himself, seemed pitiable enough,\nLittle victim unearthed by some large creature\nFrom his orbit under the elm root.\nThe second carcase makes a duel of the affair:\nBlind twins bitten by bad nature.\nThe sky's far dome is sane and clear.\nLeaves, undoing their yellow caves\nBetween the road and the lake water,\nBare no sinister spaces. Already\nThe moles look neutral as the stones.\nTheir corkscrew noses, their white hands\nUplifted, stiffen in a family pose.\nDifficult to imagine how fury struck—\nDissolved now, smoke of an old war.\nNightly the battle-shouts start up\nIn the ear of the veteran, and again\nI enter the soft pelt of the mole.\nLight's death to them: they shrivel in it.\nThey move through their mute rooms while I sleep,\nPalming the earth aside, grubbers\nAfter the fat children of root and rock.\nBy day, only the topsoil heaves.\nDown there one is alone.\nOutsize hands prepare a path,\nThey go before: opening the veins,\nDelving for the appendages\nOf beetles, sweetbreads, shards—to be eaten\nOver and over. And still the heaven\nOf final surfeit is just as far\nFrom the door as ever. What happens between us\nHappens in darkness, vanishes\nEasy and often as each breath.\n\nSTRUMPET SONG\nWith white frost gone\nAnd all green dreams not worth much,\nAfter a lean day's work\nTime comes round for that foul slut:\nMere bruit of her takes our street\nUntil every man,\nRed, pale or dark,\nVeers to her slouch.\nMark, I cry, that mouth\nMade to do violence on,\nThat seamed face\nAskew with blotch, dint, scar\nStruck by each dour year.\nWalks there not some such one man\nAs can spare breath\nTo patch with brand of love this rank grimace\nWhich out from black tarn, ditch and cup\nInto my most chaste own eyes\nLooks up.\n\nOUIJA\nIt is a chilly god, a god of shades,\nRises to the glass from his black fathoms.\nAt the window, those unborn, those undone\nAssemble with the frail paleness of moths,\nAn envious phosphorescence in their wings.\nVermilions, bronzes, colours of the sun\nIn the coal fire will not wholly console them.\nImagine their deep hunger, deep as the dark\nFor the blood-heat that would ruddle or reclaim.\nThe glass mouth sucks blood-heat from my forefinger.\nThe old god dribbles, in return, his words.\nThe old god, too, writes aureate poetry\nIn tarnished modes, maundering among the wastes,\nFair chronicler of every foul declension.\nAge, and ages of prose, have uncoiled\nHis talking whirlwind, abated his e\ncessive temper\nWhen words, like locusts, drummed the darkening air\nAnd left the cobs to rattle, bitten clean.\nSkies once wearing a blue, divine hauteur\nRavel above us, mistily descend,\nThickening with motes, to a marriage with the mire.\nHe hymns the rotten queen with saffron hair\nWho has saltier aphrodisiacs\nThan virgins' tears. That bawdy queen of death,\nHer wormy couriers are at his bones.\nStill he hymns juice of her, hot nectarine.\nI see him, horny-skinned and tough, construe\nWhat flinty pebbles the ploughblade upturns\nAs ponderable tokens of her love.\nHe, godly, doddering, spells\nNo succinct Gabriel from the letters here\nBut floridly, his amorous nostalgias.\n\nMAN IN BLACK\nWhere the three magenta\nBreakwaters take the shove\nAnd suck of the grey sea\nTo the left, and the wave\nUnfists against the dun\nBarb-wired headland of\nThe Deer Island prison\nWith its trim piggeries,\nHen huts and cattle green\nTo the right, and March ice\nGlazes the rock pools yet,\nSnuff-coloured sand cliffs rise\nOver a great stone spit\nBared by each falling tide,\nAnd you, across those white\nStones, strode out in your dead\nBlack coat, black shoes, and your\nBlack hair till there you stood,\nFi\ned vorte\n on the far\nTip, riveting stones, air,\nAll of it, together.\n\nSNAKECHARMER\nAs the gods began one world, and man another,\nSo the snakecharmer begins a snaky sphere\nWith moon-eye, mouth-pipe. He pipes. Pipes green. Pipes water.\nPipes water green until green waters waver\nWith reedy lengths and necks and undulatings.\nAnd as his notes twine green, the green river\nShapes its images around his songs.\nHe pipes a place to stand on, but no rocks,\nNo floor: a wave of flickering grass tongues\nSupports his foot. He pipes a world of snakes,\nOf sways and ceilings, from the snake-rooted bottom\nOf his mind. And now nothing but snakes\nIs visible. The snake-scales have become\nLeaf, become eyelid; snake-bodies, bough, breast\nOf tree and human. And he within this snakedom\nRides the writhings which make manifest\nHis snakehood and his might with pliant tunes\nFrom his thin pipe. Out of this green nest\nAs out of Eden's navel twist the lines\nOf snaky generations: let there be snakes!\nAnd snakes there were, are, will be—till yawns\nConsume this piper and he tires of music\nAnd pipes the world back to the simple fabric\nOf snake-warp, snake-weft. Pipes the cloth of snakes\nTo a melting of green waters, till no snake\nShows its head, and those green waters back to\nWater, to green, to nothing like a snake.\nPuts up his pipe, and lids his moony eye.\n\nTHE HERMIT AT OUTERMOST HOUSE\nSky and sea, horizon-hinged\nTablets of blank blue, couldn't,\nClapped shut, flatten this man out.\nThe great gods, Stone-Head, Claw-Foot,\nWinded by much rock-bumping\nAnd claw-threat, realised that.\nFor what, then, had they endured\nDourly the long hots and colds,\nThose old despots, if he sat\nLaugh-shaken on his doorsill,\nBackbone unbendable as\nTimbers of his upright hut?\nHard gods were there, nothing else.\nStill he thumbed out something else.\nThumbed no stony, horny pot,\nBut a certain meaning green.\nHe withstood them, that hermit.\nRock-face, crab-claw verged on green.\nGulls mulled in the greenest light.\n\nTHE DISQUIETING MUSES\nMother, mother, what illbred aunt\nOr what disfigured and unsightly\nCousin did you so unwisely keep\nUnasked to my christening, that she\nSent these ladies in her stead\nWith heads like darning-eggs to nod\nAnd nod and nod at foot and head\nAnd at the left side of my crib?\nMother, who made to order stories\nOf Mi\nie Blackshort the heroic bear,\nMother, whose witches always, always\nGot baked into gingerbread, I wonder\nWhether you saw them, whether you said\nWords to rid me of those three ladies\nNodding by night around my bed,\nMouthless, eyeless, with stitched bald head.\nIn the hurricane, when father's twelve\nStudy windows bellied in\nLike bubbles about to break, you fed\nMy brother and me cookies and ovaltine\nAnd helped the two of us to choir:\n'Thor is angry: boom boom boom!\nThor is angry: we don't care!'\nBut those ladies broke the panes.\nWhen on tiptoe the schoolgirls danced,\nBlinking flashlights like fireflies\nAnd singing the glowworm song, I could\nNot lift a foot in the twinkle-dress\nBut, heavy-footed, stood aside\nIn the shadow cast by my dismal-headed\nGodmothers, and you cried and cried:\nAnd the shadow stretched, the lights went out.\nMother, you sent me to piano lessons\nAnd praised my arabesques and trills\nAlthough each teacher found my touch\nOddly wooden in spite of scales\nAnd the hours of practising, my ear\nTone-deaf and yes, unteachable.\nI learned, I learned, I learned elsewhere,\nFrom muses unhired by you, dear mother.\nI woke one day to see you, mother,\nFloating above me in bluest air\nOn a green balloon bright with a million\nFlowers and bluebirds that never were\nNever, never, found anywhere.\nBut the little planet bobbed away\nLike a soap-bubble as you called: Come here!\nAnd I faced my travelling companions.\nDay now, night now, at head, side, feet,\nThey stand their vigil in gowns of stone,\nFaces blank as the day I was born,\nTheir shadows long in the setting sun\nThat never brightens or goes down.\nAnd this is the kingdom you bore me to,\nMother, mother. But no frown of mine\nWill betray the company I keep.\n\nMEDALLION\nBy the gate with star and moon\nWorked into the peeled orange wood\nThe bronze snake lay in the sun\nInert as a shoelace; dead\nBut pliable still, his jaw\nUnhinged and his grin crooked,\nTongue a rose-coloured arrow.\nOver my hand I hung him.\nHis little vermilion eye\nIgnited with a glassed flame\nAs I turned him in the light;\nWhen I split a rock one time\nThe garnet bits burned like that.\nDust dulled his back to ochre\nThe way sun ruins a trout.\nYet his belly kept its fire\nGoing under the chainmail,\nThe old jewels smouldering there\nIn each opaque belly-scale:\nSunset looked at through milk glass.\nAnd I saw white maggots coil\nThin as pins in the dark bruise\nWhere his innards bulged as if\nHe were digesting a mouse.\nKnifelike, he was chaste enough,\nPure death's-metal. The yardman's\nFlung brick perfected his laugh.\n\nTWO SISTERS OF PERSEPHONE\nTwo girls there are: within the house\nOne sits; the other, without.\nDaylong a duet of shade and light\nPlays between these.\nIn her dark wainscotted room\nThe first works problems on\nA mathematical machine.\nDry ticks mark time\nAs she calculates each sum.\nAt this barren enterprise\nRat-shrewd go her squint eyes,\nRoot-pale her meagre frame.\nBronzed as earth, the second lies,\nHearing ticks blown gold\nLike pollen on bright air. Lulled\nNear a bed of poppies,\nShe sees how their red silk flare\nOf petalled blood\nBurns open to sun's blade.\nOn that green altar\nFreely become sun's bride, the latter\nGrows quick with seed.\nGrass-couched in her labour's pride,\nShe bears a king. Turned bitter\nAnd sallow as any lemon,\nThe other, wry virgin to the last,\nGoes graveward with flesh laid waste,\nWorm-husbanded, yet no woman.\n\nTHE COMPANIONABLE ILLS\nThe nose-end that twitches, the old imperfections—\nTolerable now as moles on the face\nPut up with until chagrin gives place\nTo a wry complaisance—\nDug in first as God's spurs\nTo start the spirit out of the mud\nIt stabled in; long-used, became well-loved\nBedfellows of the spirit's debauch, fond masters.\n\nMOONRISE\nGrub-white mulberries redden among leaves.\nI'll go out and sit in white like they do,\nDoing nothing. July's juice rounds their nubs.\nThis park is fleshed with idiot petals.\nWhite catalpa flowers tower, topple,\nCast a round white shadow in their dying.\nA pigeon rudders down. Its fan-tail's white.\nVocation enough: opening, shutting\nWhite petals, white fan-tails, ten white fingers.\nEnough for fingernails to make half-moons\nRedden in white palms no labour reddens.\nWhite bruises toward colour, else collapses.\nBerries redden. A body of whiteness\nRots, and smells of rot under its headstone\nThough the body walk out in clean linen.\nI smell that whiteness here, beneath the stones\nWhere small ants roll their eggs, where grubs fatten.\nDeath may whiten in sun or out of it.\nDeath whitens in the egg and out of it.\nI can see no colour for this whiteness.\nWhite: it is a comple\nion of the mind.\nI tire, imagining white Niagaras\nBuild up from a rock root, as fountains build\nAgainst the weighty image of their fall.\nLucina, bony mother, labouring\nAmong the socketed white stars, your face\nOf candour pares white flesh to the white bone,\nWho drag our ancient father at the heel,\nWhite-bearded, weary. The berries purple\nAnd bleed. The white stomach may ripen yet.\n\nSPINSTER\nNow this particular girl\nDuring a ceremonious April walk\nWith her latest suitor\nFound herself, of a sudden, intolerably struck\nBy the birds' irregular babel\nAnd the leaves' litter.\nBy this tumult afflicted, she\nObserved her lover's gestures unbalance the air,\nHis gait stray uneven\nThrough a rank wilderness of fern and flower.\nShe judged petals in disarray,\nThe whole season, sloven.\nHow she longed for winter then!—\nScrupulously austere in its order\nOf white and black\nIce and rock, each sentiment within border,\nAnd heart's frosty discipline\nE\nact as a snowflake.\nBut here—a burgeoning\nUnruly enough to pitch her five queenly wits\nInto vulgar motley—\nA treason not to be borne. Let idiots\nReel giddy in bedlam spring:\nShe withdrew neatly.\nAnd round her house she set\nSuch a barricade of barb and check\nAgainst mutinous weather\nAs no mere insurgent man could hope to break\nWith curse, fist, threat\nOr love, either.\n\nFROG AUTUMN\nSummer grows old, cold-blooded mother.\nThe insects are scant, skinny.\nIn these palustral homes we only\nCroak and wither.\nMornings dissipate in somnolence.\nThe sun brightens tardily\nAmong the pithless reeds. Flies fail us.\nThe fen sickens.\nFrost drops even the spider. Clearly\nThe genius of plenitude\nHouses himself elsewhere. Our folk thin\nLamentably.\n\nMUSSEL HUNTER AT ROCK HARBOUR\nI came before the water-\nColourists came to get the\nGood of the Cape light that scours\nSand grit to sided crystal\nAnd buffs and sleeks the blunt hulls\nOf the three fishing smacks beached\nOn the bank of the river's\nBacktracking tail. I'd come for\nFree fish-bait: the blue mussels\nClumped like bulbs at the grass-root\nMargin of the tidal pools.\nDawn tide stood dead low. I smelt\nMud stench, shell guts, gulls' leavings;\nHeard a queer crusty scrabble\nCease, and I neared the silenced\nEdge of a cratered pool-bed.\nThe mussels hung dull blue and\nConspicuous, yet it seemed\nA sly world's hinges had swung\nShut against me. All held still.\nThough I counted scant seconds,\nEnough ages lapsed to win\nConfidence of safe-conduct\nIn the wary otherworld\nEyeing me. Grass put forth claws;\nSmall mud knobs, nudged from under,\nDisplaced their domes as tiny\nKnights might doff their casques. The crabs\nInched from their pygmy burrows\nAnd from the trench-dug mud, all\nCamouflaged in mottled mail\nOf browns and greens. Each wore one\nClaw swollen to a shield large\nAs itself—no fiddler's arm\nGrown Gargantuan by trade,\nBut grown grimly, and grimly\nBorne, for a use beyond my\nGuessing of it. Sibilant\nMass-motived hordes, they sidled\nOut in a converging stream\nToward the pool-mouth, perhaps to\nMeet the thin and sluggish thread\nOf sea retracing its tide-\nWay up the river-basin.\nOr to avoid me. They moved\nObliquely with a dry-wet\nSound, with a glittery wisp\nAnd trickle. Could they feel mud\nPleasurable under claws\nAs I could between bare toes?\nThat question ended it—I\nStood shut out, for once, for all,\nPuzzling the passage of their\nAbsolutely alien\nOrder as I might puzzle\nAt the clear tail of Halley's\nComet coolly giving my\nOrbit the go-by, made known\nBy a family name it\nKnew nothing of. So the crabs\nWent about their business, which\nWasn't fiddling, and I filled\nA big handkerchief with blue\nMussels. From what the crabs saw,\nIf they could see, I was one\nTwo-legged mussel-picker.\nHigh on the air thatching\nOf the dense grasses I found\nThe husk of a fiddler-crab,\nIntact, strangely strayed above\nHis world of mud—green colour\nAnd innards bleached and blown off\nSomewhere by much sun and wind;\nThere was no telling if he'd\nDied recluse or suicide\nOr headstrong Columbus crab.\nThe crab-face, etched and set there,\nGrimaced as skulls grimace: it\nHad an Oriental look,\nA samurai death mask done\nOn a tiger tooth, less for\nArt's sake than God's. Far from sea—\nWhere red-freckled crab-backs, claws\nAnd whole crabs, dead, their soggy\nBellies pallid and upturned,\nPerform their shambling waltzes\nOn the waves' dissolving turn\nAnd return, losing themselves\nBit by bit to their friendly\nElement—this relic saved\nFace, to face the bald-faced sun.\n\nTHE BEEKEEPER'S DAUGHTER\nA garden of mouthings. Purple, scarlet-speckled, black\nThe great corollas dilate, peeling back their silks.\nTheir musk encroaches, circle after circle,\nA well of scents almost too dense to breathe in.\nHieratical in your frock coat, maestro of the bees,\nYou move among the many-breasted hives,\nMy heart under your foot, sister of a stone.\nTrumpet-throats open to the beaks of birds.\nThe Golden Rain Tree drips its powders down.\nIn these little boudoirs streaked with orange and red\nThe anthers nod their heads, potent as kings\nTo father dynasties. The air is rich.\nHere is a queenship no mother can contest—\nA fruit that's death to taste: dark flesh, dark parings.\nIn burrows narrow as a finger, solitary bees\nKeep house among the grasses. Kneeling down\nI set my eye to a hole-mouth and meet an eye\nRound, green, disconsolate as a tear.\nFather, bridegroom, in this Easter egg\nUnder the coronal of sugar roses\nThe queen bee marries the winter of your year.\n\nTHE TIMES ARE TIDY\nUnlucky the hero born\nIn this province of the stuck record\nWhere the most watchful cooks go jobless\nAnd the mayor's rotisserie turns\nRound of its own accord.\nThere's no career in the venture\nOf riding against the lizard,\nHimself withered these latter-days\nTo leaf-size from lack of action:\nHistory's beaten the hazard.\nThe last crone got burnt up\nMore than eight decades back\nWith the love-hot herb, the talking cat,\nBut the children are better for it,\nThe cow milk's cream an inch thick.\n\nTHE BURNT-OUT SPA\nAn old beast ended in this place:\nA monster of wood and rusty teeth.\nFire smelted his eyes to lumps\nOf pale blue vitreous stuff, opaque\nAs resin drops oozed from pine bark.\nThe rafters and struts of his body wear\nTheir char of karakul still. I can't tell\nHow long his carcase has foundered under\nThe rubbish of summers, the black-leaved falls.\nNow little weeds insinuate\nSoft suede tongues between his bones.\nHis armourplate, his toppled stones\nAre an esplanade for crickets.\nI pick and pry like a doctor or\nArchaeologist among\nIron entrails, enamel bowls,\nThe coils and pipes that made him run.\nThe small dell eats what ate it once.\nAnd yet the ichor of the spring\nProceeds clear as it ever did\nFrom the broken throat, the marshy lip.\nIt flows off below the green and white\nBalustrade of a sag-backed bridge.\nLeaning over, I encounter one\nBlue and improbable person\nFramed in a basketwork of cat-tails.\nO she is gracious and austere,\nSeated beneath the toneless water!\nIt is not I, it is not I.\nNo animal spoils on her green doorstep.\nAnd we shall never enter there\nWhere the durable ones keep house.\nThe stream that hustles us\nNeither nourishes nor heals.\n\nSCULPTOR\nFor Leonard Baskin\nTo his house the bodiless\nCome to barter endlessly\nVision, wisdom, for bodies\nPalpable as his, and weighty.\nHands moving move priestlier\nThan priest's hands, invoke no vain\nImages of light and air\nBut sure stations in bronze, wood, stone.\nObdurate, in dense-grained wood,\nA bald angel blocks and shapes\nThe flimsy light; arms folded\nWatches his cumbrous world eclipse\nInane worlds of wind and cloud.\nBronze dead dominate the floor,\nResistive, ruddy-bodied,\nDwarfing us. Our bodies flicker\nToward e\ntinction in those eyes\nWhich, without him, were beggared\nOf place, time, and their bodies.\nEmulous spirits make discord,\nTry entry, enter nightmares\nUntil his chisel bequeaths\nThem life livelier than ours,\nA solider repose than death's.\n\nPOEM FOR A BIRTHDAY\n1. Who\nThe month of flowering's finished. The fruit's in,\nEaten or rotten. I am all mouth.\nOctober's the month for storage.\nThis shed's fusty as a mummy's stomach:\nOld tools, handles and rusty tusks.\nI am at home here among the dead heads.\nLet me sit in a flowerpot,\nThe spiders won't notice.\nMy heart is a stopped geranium.\nIf only the wind would leave my lungs alone.\nDogbody noses the petals. They bloom upside down.\nThey rattle like hydrangea bushes.\nMouldering heads console me,\nNailed to the rafters yesterday:\nInmates who don't hibernate.\nCabbageheads: wormy purple, silver-glaze,\nA dressing of mule ears, mothy pelts, but green-hearted,\nTheir veins white as porkfat.\nO the beauty of usage!\nThe orange pumpkins have no eyes.\nThese halls are full of women who think they are birds.\nThis is a dull school.\nI am a root, a stone, an owl pellet,\nWithout dreams of any sort.\nMother, you are the one mouth\nI would be a tongue to. Mother of otherness\nEat me. Wastebasket gaper, shadow of doorways.\nI said: I must remember this, being small.\nThere were such enormous flowers,\nPurple and red mouths, utterly lovely.\nThe hoops of blackberry stems made me cry.\nNow they light me up like an electric bulb.\nFor weeks I can remember nothing at all.\n2. Dark House\nThis is a dark house, very big.\nI made it myself,\nCell by cell from a quiet corner,\nChewing at the grey paper,\nOozing the glue drops,\nWhistling, wiggling my ears,\nThinking of something else.\nIt has so many cellars,\nSuch eelish delvings!\nI am round as an owl,\nI see by my own light.\nAny day I may litter puppies\nOr mother a horse. My belly moves.\nI must make more maps.\nThese marrowy tunnels!\nMoley-handed, I eat my way.\nAll-mouth licks up the bushes\nAnd the pots of meat.\nHe lives in an old well,\nA stony hole. He's to blame.\nHe's a fat sort.\nPebble smells, turnipy chambers.\nSmall nostrils are breathing.\nLittle humble loves!\nFootlings, boneless as noses,\nIt is warm and tolerable\nIn the bowel of the root.\nHere's a cuddly mother.\n3. Maenad\nOnce I was ordinary:\nSat by my father's bean tree\nEating the fingers of wisdom.\nThe birds made milk.\nWhen it thundered I hid under a flat stone.\nThe mother of mouths didn't love me.\nThe old man shrank to a doll.\nO I am too big to go backward:\nBirdmilk is feathers,\nThe bean leaves are dumb as hands.\nThis month is fit for little.\nThe dead ripen in the grapeleaves.\nA red tongue is among us.\nMother, keep out of my barnyard,\nI am becoming another.\nDog-head, devourer:\nFeed me the berries of dark.\nThe lids won't shut. Time\nUnwinds from the great umbilicus of the sun\nIts endless glitter.\nI must swallow it all.\nLady, who are these others in the moon's vat—\nSleepdrunk, their limbs at odds?\nIn this light the blood is black.\nTell me my name.\n4. The Beast\nHe was bullman earlier,\nKing of the dish, my lucky animal.\nBreathing was easy in his airy holding.\nThe sun sat in his armpit.\nNothing went mouldy. The little invisibles\nWaited on him hand and foot.\nThe blue sisters sent me to another school.\nMonkey lived under the dunce cap.\nHe kept blowing me kisses.\nI hardly knew him.\nHe won't be got rid of:\nMumblepaws, teary and sorry,\nFido Littlesoul, the bowel's familiar.\nA dustbin's enough for him.\nThe dark's his bone.\nCall him any name, he'll come to it.\nMud-sump, happy sty-face.\nI've married a cupboard of rubbish.\nI bed in a fish puddle.\nDown here the sky is always falling.\nHogwallow's at the window.\nThe star bugs won't save me this month.\nI housekeep in Time's gut-end\nAmong emmets and molluscs,\nDuchess of Nothing,\nHairtusk's bride.\n5. Flute Notes from a Reedy Pond\nNow coldness comes sifting down, layer after layer,\nTo our bower at the lily root.\nOverhead the old umbrellas of summer\nWither like pithless hands. There is little shelter.\nHourly the eye of the sky enlarges its blank\nDominion. The stars are no nearer.\nAlready frog-mouth and fish-mouth drink\nThe liquor of indolence, and all things sink\nInto a soft caul of forgetfulness.\nThe fugitive colours die.\nCaddis worms drowse in their silk cases,\nThe lamp-headed nymphs are nodding to sleep like statues.\nPuppets, loosed from the strings of the puppet-master,\nWear masks of horn to bed.\nThis is not death, it is something safer.\nThe wingy myths won't tug at us any more:\nThe moults are tongueless that sang from above the water\nOf golgotha at the tip of a reed,\nAnd how a god flimsy as a baby's finger\nShall unhusk himself and steer into the air.\n6. Witch Burning\nIn the marketplace they are piling the dry sticks.\nA thicket of shadows is a poor coat. I inhabit\nThe wa\n image of myself, a doll's body.\nSickness begins here: I am a dartboard for witches.\nOnly the devil can eat the devil out.\nIn the month of red leaves I climb to a bed of fire.\nIt is easy to blame the dark: the mouth of a door,\nThe cellar's belly. They've blown my sparkler out.\nA black-sharded lady keeps me in a parrot cage.\nWhat large eyes the dead have!\nI am intimate with a hairy spirit.\nSmoke wheels from the beak of this empty jar.\nIf I am a little one, I can do no harm.\nIf I don't move about, I'll knock nothing over. So I said,\nSitting under a potlid, tiny and inert as a rice grain.\nThey are turning the burners up, ring after ring.\nWe are full of starch, my small white fellows. We grow.\nIt hurts at first. The red tongues will teach the truth.\nMother of beetles, only unclench your hand:\nI'll fly through the candle's mouth like a singeless moth.\nGive me back my shape. I am ready to construe the days\nI coupled with dust in the shadow of a stone.\nMy ankles brighten. Brightness ascends my thighs.\nI am lost, I am lost, in the robes of all this light.\n\n7. The Stones\nThis is the city where men are mended.\nI lie on a great anvil.\nThe flat blue sky-circle\nFlew off like the hat of a doll\nWhen I fell out of the light. I entered\nThe stomach of indifference, the wordless cupboard.\nThe mother of pestles diminished me.\nI became a still pebble.\nThe stones of the belly were peaceable,\nThe head-stone quiet, jostled by nothing.\nOnly the mouth-hole piped out,\nImportunate cricket\nIn a quarry of silences.\nThe people of the city heard it.\nThey hunted the stones, taciturn and separate,\nThe mouth-hole crying their locations.\nDrunk as a foetus\nI suck at the paps of darkness.\nThe food tubes embrace me. Sponges kiss my lichens away.\nThe jewelmaster drives his chisel to pry\nOpen one stone eye.\nThis is the after-hell: I see the light.\nA wind unstoppers the chamber\nOf the car, old worrier.\nWater mollifies the flint lip,\nAnd daylight lays its sameness on the wall.\nThe grafters are cheerful,\nHeating the pincers, hoisting the delicate hammers.\nA current agitates the wires\nVolt upon volt. Catgut stitches my fissures.\nA workman walks by carrying a pink torso.\nThe storerooms are full of hearts.\nThis is the city of spare parts.\nMy swaddled legs and arms smell sweet as rubber.\nHere they can doctor heads, or any limb.\nOn Fridays the little children come\nTo trade their hooks for hands.\nDead men leave eyes for others.\nLove is the uniform of my bald nurse.\nLove is the bone and sinew of my curse.\nThe vase, reconstructed, houses\nThe elusive rose.\nTen fingers shape a bowl for shadows.\nMy mendings itch. There is nothing to do.\nI shall be good as new.\n
